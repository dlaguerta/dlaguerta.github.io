I guess I should start with an introduction of sorts: I'm Dianne, I live in Seattle with my beautiful fianc√© Iris, and I have a cat named Foot Foot. I currently work as a software engineer, but I don't like to define myself based on my job.

This blog is meant to be a place for me to share what I'm currently interested in, what I'm learning, and maybe recap some of my personal growth and doings around the city and beyond.

You'll see me blog about various topics, and I hope you're ok with that.
